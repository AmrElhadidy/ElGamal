# ElGamal
Implementation of ElGamal Encryption Algorithm in C#


The ElGamal encryption system is an symmetric key encryption algorithm for private-key cryptography which is based on the public key exchange. The system provides an additional layer of security by asymmetrically encrypting keys previously used for asymmetric message encryption. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985.


Developed in .NET framework using C#.


Notes: Code uses System.Numerics library to deal with Big Integers.
